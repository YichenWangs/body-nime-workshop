# Workshop Description

This workshop explores performing experience with NIME
systems through bodily interaction, unliving body maps
to explore changes in body perception elicited by curated
NIME systems. Participants are encouraged to bring their
own instruments for exploration.
The workshop aims to bring together practitioners deeply
engaged in bodily interactions within NIME design, those
curious about the interplay between their body and NIMEs,
and anyone interested in bodily musical experience
