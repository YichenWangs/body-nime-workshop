# [Yichen Wang](https://yichenwangs.github.io) (The Australian National University)

Yichen’s interdisciplinary research encompasses new interfaces for musical expression, augmented reality, and the social dynamics of digital music ensembles within Human-Computer Interaction. She is interested in how augmented reality supports musical creativity for musicians, both individually and in collaboration. Yichen has performed with her mixed reality musical instrument at OzCHI’22, NIME’23, and ACMC’23. Her latest work on mixed reality instrument design and ensemble performance will be featured at ISEA’24.
