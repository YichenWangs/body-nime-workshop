The workshop will follow the following structure. We will provide body maps templates, papers, carton for you to explore bodily experiences with NIMEs, have fun!

## 1. Introduction to the Body Maps Concept and Warm-up (20 mins)
The workshop begins with an introduction to the body maps
concept, its context and how it will be used in later practical
activities.

## 2. Body Sensitisation to Physical Work with NIME (10 mins)
This session provides a sensory and movement warm-up de-
signed to heighten participants awareness of their bodies in
relation to the physicality NIMEs, inspired by Butoh dancer
[Atsushi Takenouchi](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780203001035/hijikata-tatsumi-ohno-kazuo-sondra-fraleigh-tamah-nakamura). This warm-up aims to attune par-
ticipants to the diverse bodily sensations evoked by NIME
interactions.

## 3. Body Maps in Action with Curated NIMEs (40 mins)
This session demonstrates the use of body maps with four
distinct open-source NIME systems. This aims to show
how bodily experiences are unfolded by different creative
expressions. The selected NIME systems offer unique sonic
bodily experiences, including:

- Touching wires: A bela-based sound quilt that explores embodied musical interactions.
- Thanles: A low-cost instrument made up of two handheld magnetic controllers that interact with additional magnets to create a tactile sensation of sound during performance.   
- CUBE: A mixed reality musical instrument that offers spatial music-making experiences with embodied virtual musical cubes.
- #otherbeats: An online experimental sound instrument  facilitated by gestural interaction on a trackpad and featuring grid-based sound recordings.

Participants will be organised into groups to interact with one of these systems and document their experiences using the body maps
template. Online participants will form a virtual group.

## 4. Body Maps with Personal NIME Exploration (30 mins)
In this session, participants will employ the body maps tool
with their NIMEs, similar to the previous section. This session aims to provoke thoughtful reflections and insights into
the intimate relationship between the performer and their
own instrument. For those without their instruments on
hand, we courage collaboration or conceptual engagement.
Online participants will complete this remotely.

## 5. Collective Reflection (20 mins)
The workshop will end with a group reflection where participants will share their experiences and create a collective
body map. This will help discuss how various technologies affect their experiences with sound. A final discussion
will summarise these experiences, highlighting how these insights shape body experience design in creative expression
